# WorkFiles
WorkFiles is a gem to make programmatic file attachment and CRUD operations
in Hyrax easier â€” both for primary repository files and derivatives.  This
simplifies both ingest and programmatic introspection of file attachments to
repository assets in Hyrax-based repositories, and abstracts many complicated
aspects of native Hyrax calling interfaces for dealing with attachment
and access of attached files.

## Installation and Usage
Add dependency of 'work_files' in the gemspec of your Hyrax-based app or engine,
and run `bundle install`.
